What is a Web Request?

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.

There are two main types of web request:

*GET request:GET carries request parameter appended in URL string

*POST request:POST carries request parameter in message body which makes it more secure way of transferring data from client to server in http protocol.
